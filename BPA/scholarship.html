                <h2>SCHOLARSHIP FOR SIGHTLESS STUDENTS</h2>
                <h3>KAMALENDU BHATTACHARYA MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP</h3>
                <p>The members and well-wishers of the organisation started a scholarship fund in the year 2001-02 in the memory of late Kamalendu Bhattacharya who passed away on February 8, 1998. Kamalendu Bhattacharya along with Shibabrata Sengupta and Tarun Sengupta played a significant role in rejuvenating the organisation in the sixties and rebuilding it in its present form. Many of the members were his direct students at Blind Boys’ Academy, Ramakrishna Ashrama at Narendrapur. His love for his pupils and his positive approach endeared him to each and everybody who came closer to him. He exerted his whole energy to developing a social movement for securing the legitimate rights of the sightless people.</p>
                <p>This scholarship of Rs. 1,800 per annum is awarded to the sightless students for two years from amongst applicants who pass the secondary examination (Madhyamik Pariksa). This is a merit-cum-means scholarship, i.e., the results and the situation of the students are taken into account at the time of selection.</p>

                <h3>KESHAB CHANDRA BHATTACHARYYA AND SAROJBASINI DEVI MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP</h3>
                <p>A scholarship of Rs. 5,000 per annum is available in the memory of Keshab Chandra Bhattacharyya and Sarojbasini Debi. This scholarship will be awarded to a sightless student for three years for his/her outstanding performance in the Higher Secondary Examination. In this case also the applicant must be a resident of West Bengal and continue his study in the next grade.</p>

                <p>Willing donors may also sponsor a scholarship to encourage visually challenged students in their academic studies.</p>
